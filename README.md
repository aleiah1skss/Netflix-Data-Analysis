NETFLIX DATA : CLEANING, ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of a Netflix content dataset to uncover key insights and trends. The project focuses on a complete data science workflow, from raw data to actionable visualizations.

Methodology:
> The project was conducted in several key phases:

> Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The raw dataset was loaded and cleaned to handle missing values and correct data types. This ensured the data was accurate and ready for analysis.

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A wide range of visualizations was created to explore the dataset. This included analyzing the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows), identifying the top content-producing countries and directors, and understanding content rating trends.

> Advanced Analysis: The project moved beyond basic analysis to uncover more complex insights. This involved:

> Time-Series Analysis: Analyzing content additions over time to identify monthly and yearly growth trends.

> Genre & Rating Analysis: Examining the relationship between content ratings and genres.

> Visualization: Compelling plots were generated to effectively communicate the findings, making the project's insights easy to understand.

Key Findings:
Content Mix: The Netflix library in the dataset is primarily composed of Movies.

Rapid Expansion: The number of titles added to the platform has shown a clear and significant increase over the years, with notable trends in monthly additions.

Content Focus: The most common genres were identified through a word cloud, highlighting the content categories that Netflix is focusing on.

Top Producers: The analysis identified the most prolific countries and directors contributing content to the platform.

>>> This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, showcasing skills in data manipulation, visualization, and the ability to extract valuable business insights from raw data.
